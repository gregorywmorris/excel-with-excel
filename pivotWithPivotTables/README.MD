# Promoted!
Congrats! you've just been promoted to VP of retail operations for a medium-sized homewares store. You've built your whole career on your deep understanding of customer behaviors. You're the go-to expert for understanding pricing strategy, customer insights, and market segmentation.

That's the good news. The bad news is it's the 21st century. retail shops just can't seem to compete. The retail behemoths are squeezing your  45-store business.

Before you were promoted you worked on integrating a state-of-the-art data collection system into all store operations. This system allows you to see weekly data trends.

Your iceberg is melting and it's time for change. Your role is to create a strategy for the business and deliver on the results. What will you decide?
